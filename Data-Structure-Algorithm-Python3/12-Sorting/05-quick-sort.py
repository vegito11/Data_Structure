"""
	1) Choose start index element as pivot element
	2) Now go from From LEFT=Start+1 go to right until we reach to Element which is Greater than PIVOT
	3) Now go from From RIGHT=Last go to left until we reach to Element which is Less than PIVOT
	4) Now Swap this element LeftIndex which element greater than Pivot with rightIndex smaller than 
	   pivot element 
	5) Note: In while condtion of right we have not included right > left bcz at last swap we have to 
	         find out element which are going to swap with pivot . That is pivot position
	6) At last we move rightIndex to point where we will get element less than pivot so It will be 
	   pivot position as leftIndex must have completed its movement

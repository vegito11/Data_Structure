"""
### Use the Vertical Order Traversal for this . Print the last node in each group 
 that is In each Horizotal Traversal group print last Node . As we use VOT it implitly sort the 
 elements so we don't' need to append them explicitly while coding 
 When we print Node at HD we print only one as per Rules Even we see them on same level in Dia but they 
 overlap hence whatever we   do will be right

1) When function makes one or more calls to itself it is called Recurssion
2) Whenever you are trying to develope a recursive solution it is very important 
   to think about BASE CASE 
3) As your solution need to return the BASE CASE once all the recursive cases have been 
   worked through

NOTE : always imagine input or design at each and what it will return to previous step 
	   Example : Reverse link List 
				 Here you can see that 20 is repeated in next step 30 in next step
	   [10][20]  [20][30] [30][40] [40][50]
